# Stock_Market_Preduction
Stock Market Prediction using various Time Series Forecasting methods and Deep Learning method LSTM

Predicting stock price using simple LSTM model. (Intitutive and easy to learn model).

Learning involves 9 years and 8 months of data and last 4 months of data is being used for testing porpurse.

Model is trained to learn the trend/pattern of stock, rather than actual stock price.

LSTM model of keras library is being used for simplicity.

120 days(6 months) of time units (i.e, previous 6 month of data is being used to predict next stock price)
